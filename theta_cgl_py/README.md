## SageMath implementation

The ThetaCGL hash function has been implemented in SageMath. Radical $\ell$-isogenies in dimensions one, two and three are included in the files `dim1.py`, `dim2.py` and `dim3.py` respectively. Examples and test values for the Rust code are generated in `example.py` and can be run using 

```
sage example.py
```
