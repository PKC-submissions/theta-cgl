## Rust implementation

The ThetaCGL hash function has been implemented in Rust. Radical $\ell$-isogenies in dimensions one, two and three are included in the files `src/dimension_one.rs`, `src/dimension_two.rs` and `src/dimension_three.rs` respectively. 

For each genus, there is a hand-written implementation of $\mathbb{F}\_p$ arithmetic in the `src/finitefield` directory targeting 128-bit security. All arithmetic for $\mathbb{F}\_{p^2}$ is generated by a macro in `src/finitefield/fp2_gen.rs`

All code has been written to run in "constant time".

Tests can be run using the command

```
cargo test
```

Benchmarks of the hash functions can be obtained by running

```
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo bench
```
