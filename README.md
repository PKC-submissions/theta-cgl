# Radical 2-isogenies in theta coordinates and cryptographic applications

Code implementing the ThetaCGL hash function in both Rust and SageMath. For more information about each implementation, see the README.md files in the corresponding directories `theta_cgl_py` and `theta_cgl_rust`

Additional symbolic proofs of statements made in the paper are contained in `verifications`.
